# NBC-KNN-SVM-Disease
This project deals with Naive Bayes Classifiers, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines(linear and non-linear kernel functions), Ensemble learning techniques (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier's) in order to build a disease diagnosis model. It is a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a patient has a certain unspecified disease.
